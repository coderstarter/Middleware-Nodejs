Using `express.Router` and `app.get`, `app.post`, etc., in Express.js serves different purposes and addresses different needs in web application development. Here's an explanation of why you might want to use `express.Router` even though you can achieve similar functionality with just `app.get`, `app.post`, and other route handling methods:

### 1. **Modularity and Organization**

#### Without `express.Router`
When using only `app.get`, `app.post`, etc., all routes are defined in the main application file (e.g., `app.js`). This can quickly become unmanageable as your application grows.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
  res.send('List of users');
});

app.post('/users', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Create a user');
});

app.get('/products', (req, res) => {
  res.send('List of products');
});

app.post('/products', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Create a product');
});

// ... more routes

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

#### With `express.Router`
Using `express.Router`, you can split routes into separate modules. This keeps your code organized and easier to maintain.

```javascript
// app.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

const userRoutes = require('./routes/users');
const productRoutes = require('./routes/products');

app.use('/users', userRoutes);
app.use('/products', productRoutes);

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

```javascript
// routes/users.js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('List of users');
});

router.post('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Create a user');
});

module.exports = router;
```

```javascript
// routes/products.js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('List of products');
});

router.post('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Create a product');
});

module.exports = router;
```

### 2. **Separation of Concerns**

Separating routes into different modules promotes the separation of concerns. Each module handles a specific part of your application (e.g., user-related operations, product-related operations). This makes the codebase more modular and easier to understand.

### 3. **Reusability**

With `express.Router`, you can reuse route modules across different parts of your application or even in different applications.

### 4. **Middleware Application**

`express.Router` allows you to apply middleware to specific route groups. This is useful for adding authentication, logging, or other middleware to a set of related routes.

```javascript
// routes/users.js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

// Middleware specific to user routes
router.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('User route accessed');
  next();
});

router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('List of users');
});

router.post('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Create a user');
});

module.exports = router;
```

### 5. **Cleaner Codebase**

Organizing routes into separate files/modules results in a cleaner and more maintainable codebase. This is especially important in large applications with many routes.

### Summary

- **Modularity**: `express.Router` allows you to split your routes into separate files/modules, making your code more modular and organized.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each module handles a specific part of your application, promoting the separation of concerns.
- **Reusability**: You can reuse route modules across different parts of your application or in different applications.
- **Middleware Application**: Apply middleware to specific route groups easily.
- **Cleaner Codebase**: Results in a cleaner and more maintainable codebase.

While `app.get`, `app.post`, etc., are sufficient for small applications, `express.Router` provides a more scalable and maintainable approach for larger applications.
